 *
 * Description:
 *     Convert @scsilun from a struct scsi_lun to a four byte host byte-ordered
 *     integer, and return the result. The caller must check for
 *     truncation before using this function.
 *
 * Notes:
 *     The struct scsi_lun is assumed to be four levels, with each level
 *     effectively containing a SCSI byte-ordered (big endian) short; the
 *     addressing bits of each level are ignored (the highest two bits).
 *     For a description of the LUN format, post SCSI-3 see the SCSI
 *     Architecture Model, for SCSI-3 see the SCSI Controller Commands.
 *
 *     Given a struct scsi_lun of: 0a 04 0b 03 00 00 00 00, this function
 *     returns the integer: 0x0b030a04
